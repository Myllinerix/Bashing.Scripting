# Bashing.Scripting
Little scripts to help with file logistics in your Linux system.

There are two scripts:
One to easily mount All existing unmounted partitions in the system (, that have a size of at least 1GB);
And one to (more) easily move the large amount of files from one disk to several disks. - when the space will end at the first disk,
the script will automatically try to move remaining files on the second, and so on, and so forth.

Have fun with them.
