# Bashing.Scripting
Little scripts to help with file logistics in your Linux system.

There are two scripts:
One to easily mount All existing unmounted partitions in the system (, that have a size at least of 1GB);
And one to (more) easily move large amount of files from one disk to several disks. - when the space will end at the first disk,
the script will automatically try to move remaining files on second, and so on, and so forth.

Have fun with them.
